# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is of paramount importance to this project.
That being said, an oopsie may happen and it is crucial for us to be informed promptly. This document provides an overview of the supported versions and instructions on reporting any security-related issues or vulnerabilities you might discover.

## Supported Versions

`hyperion` is still in its developmental phases, and we haven't rolled out a 1.0.0 release yet. Currently, we are offering support for the latest release and the previous one.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Addressing security issues can be time-consuming, but rest assured, we take them very seriously and endeavor to resolve them as swiftly as possible. If you identify a security vulnerability in `hyperion`, we urge you to notify us.

### Steps to Report a Vulnerability

1. Create a new issue in our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/tomasvotava/hyperion/issues).
2. Assign the `security` label to the issue.
3. Furnish a detailed description of the issue, specifying where the vulnerability occurs, the steps to reproduce it, and its potential impacts.

### What to Expect

We will acknowledge the receipt of your vulnerability report and keep you posted on the progress regularly.

### Disclosure Policy

In the realm of coding etiquette, it is generally frowned upon to publicly disclose issues without prior communication with us.
Therefore, we ask you to discuss any grievances or concerns about `hyperion` with us before publicizing them.

In other words, if there's something concerning `hyperion` you'd like to bitch about, let us know and we'll bitch about it together.

## Thank You

Raising an issue is a significant contribution, and we always appreciate discovering that people are using `hyperion`. We am thankful for any insights or feedback provided.
